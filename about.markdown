![This is I.](/assets/about/0.jpg)

My name is Jakub Hladik but I usually go by Jake. I am a Christian. I am married. I work as a FPGA design engineer. I was born and grew up in the Czech Republic and now live in the United States. I enjoy learning, teaching others, playing and listening to music, photography, astronomy, flying, hiking, and having discussions with friends.

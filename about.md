My name is Jakub Hladik but I usually go by "Jake". I was born and grew up in the Czech Republic and now live in the United States. I am a married Christian. I work as an FPGA design engineer. I enjoy learning, teaching others, playing and listening to music, photography, astronomy, flying, hiking, and having discussions with friends.

> "When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers,  
> The moon and the stars, which You have ordained;  
> What is man that You take thought of him,  
> And the son of man that You care for him?  
> Yet You have made him a little lower than God,  
> And You crown him with glory and majesty!"  
> **-- Psalm 8:3-5 (NASB 1995)**

<!-- > "Then God said, 'Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.' God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. God blessed them; and God said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.'"  
> **-- Genesis 1:26-27 (NASB 1995)**

> "Seek the LORD while He may be found;  
> Call upon Him while He is near.  
> Let the wicked forsake his way  
> And the unrighteous man his thoughts;  
> And let him return to the LORD,  
> And He will have compassion on him,  
> And to our God,  
> For He will abundantly pardon."  
> **-- Isaiah 55:6-7 (NASB 1995)**

> "And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest. But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them."  
> **-- Ephesians 2:1-10 (NASB 1995)**

> "This you know, my beloved brethren. But everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger; for the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God. Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness, in humility receive the word implanted, which is able to save your souls. But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror; for once he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was. But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the law of liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an effectual doer, this man will be blessed in what he does."  
> **-- James 1:19-25 (NASB 1995)**

> "Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."  
> **-- Matthew 10:28 (NASB 1995)**

> "Then all the people said to Samuel, 'Pray for your servants to the LORD your God, so that we may not die, for we have added to all our sins this evil by asking for ourselves a king.' Samuel said to the people, 'Do not fear. You have committed all this evil, yet do not turn aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart. You must not turn aside, for then you would go after futile things which can not profit or deliver, because they are futile. For the LORD will not abandon His people on account of His great name, because the LORD has been pleased to make you a people for Himself. Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you; but I will instruct you in the good and right way. Only fear the LORD and serve Him in truth with all your heart; for consider what great things He has done for you. But if you still do wickedly, both you and your king will be swept away.'"
> **-- 1 Samuel 12:19-25 (NASB 1995)**

> "When they entered, he looked at Eliab and thought, 'Surely the LORDâ€™s anointed is before Him.' But the LORD said to Samuel, 'Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for God sees not as man sees, for man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.'"  
> **-- 1 Samuel 16:6-7 (NASB 1995)**

> "The wicked flee when no one is pursuing,  
> But the righteous are bold as a lion."  
> **-- Proverbs 28:1 (NASB 1995)**

> "How have the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!  
> Jonathan is slain on your high places.  
> I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan;  
> You have been very pleasant to me.  
> Your love to me was more wonderful  
> Than the love of women."  
> **-- 2 Samuel 1:25-26 (NASB 1995)** -->
